<h1>Welcome to the CEPT_Workshop_January2019 wiki!</h1>

Hello! Welcome to the world of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis methods. This tutorial contains simple examples of uncertainty propagation using Monte Carlo analysis and a simple linear model of a building's thermal characteristics [1].

This repository contains Python scripts and Python-based Jupyter notebooks to accompany Parag Rastogi's seminar and workshop at CEPT University, Ahmedabad, India, on 05-06 January 2019. 

Parag is the sole author of these scripts. The scripts are meant to be used for instructional use only - the author does not accept any liability for their use for other purposes. This repo carries the the GPLv3 license (see the LICENSE file for details).
