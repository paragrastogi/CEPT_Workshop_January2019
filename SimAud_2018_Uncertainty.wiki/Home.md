<h1>Welcome to the CEPT_Weather_Uncertainty wiki!</h1>

Hello! Welcome to the world of uncertainty and sensitivity analysis methods. This tutorial contains simple examples of uncertainty propagation using Monte Carlo analysis and a simple linear model of a building's thermal characteristics published in Clarke [1].

This repository contains Python scripts and Python-based Jupyter notebooks to accompany Parag Rastogi's seminar and workshop in CEPT University, Ahmedabad, India, on 06 January 2018. 

Parag is the sole author of these scripts. The scripts are meant to be used for instructional use only - the author does not accept any liability for their use and misuse for other purposes. This repo carries the the GPLv3 license (see the LICENSE file for details).
